# Approach

There were two full CRUD implemented in this full stack MERN application. The inventory and its comments can be both created, deleted, upadated, and read and are stored in MongoDB cloud storage. Below is the mention of the technologies used


# Technologies used

• MongoDB/Mongoose: Used to store the user and inventory info

• React was used to make the front page and UI

• Npm packages were utilized for different functionalities (node.js)

• BootStrap was utilized for styling the nav bar

• Express.js was implement in the backend


# Next steps for improvement
If the business want to sell items that are not in the inventory, the application allow the customer to search an item by search bar and using an api

The app auto populate the price and an item location in the comments
